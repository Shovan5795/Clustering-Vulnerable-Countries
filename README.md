In many developing and poor countries, people often
migrate to suitable countries to earn their livelihood and support
their families. Due to the ongoing pecuniary disaster that ensued
because of COVID-19, many immigrants are coming back to their
ancestry from different migrant-friendly countries for several
reasons. In this paper, a novel approach has been proposed to
segregate these countries into five vulnerability labels based on
probabilistic likelihood score (LHS) and unsupervised clustering
algorithms (CA). A survey dataset of returnee people including
various information has been collected and leveraged as attributes
in this study. Depending on the dissemination of attributes, LHS
has been generated using Bayes’ Theorem for each vulnerable
country and three unsupervised mining algorithms (KMeans++,
Agglomerative and BIRCH) have been applied to the LHS
for categorization. Output labels obtained from CA are then
evaluated appropriating the average LHS. Multiple performance
measurement metrics (Adjusted Rand Index, Mutual Information
based Score) have been consolidated to get an incisive comparison
of vulnerability labels resulting from CA and expected LHS. The
highest value of 0.74 has been attained as Normalized Mutual
Information based Score for BIRCH clustering accompanying
ample results for the remaining algorithms. The result has
shown that the combined application of probabilistic LHS and
unsupervised CA can be a reliable method to identify the
vulnerability of different countries generally chosen by migrant
people.
